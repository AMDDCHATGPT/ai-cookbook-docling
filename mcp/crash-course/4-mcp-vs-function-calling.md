## Part 4: Comparing MCP to Traditional Approaches

### Side-by-Side Comparison

Let's compare our MCP implementation to a traditional function-calling approach:

**Traditional Function Calling:**

```python
# tools.py
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers together"""
    return a + b

# main.py
from tools import add
import openai
import json

# Define tools for the model
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "add",
            "description": "Add two numbers together",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "a": {"type": "integer", "description": "First number"},
                    "b": {"type": "integer", "description": "Second number"}
                },
                "required": ["a", "b"]
            }
        }
    }
]

# Call LLM
response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Calculate 25 + 17"}],
    tools=tools
)

# Handle tool calls
if response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:
    tool_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]
    tool_name = tool_call.function.name
    tool_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
    
    # Execute directly
    result = add(**tool_args)
    
    # Send result back to model
    final_response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "Calculate 25 + 17"},
            response.choices[0].message,
            {
                "role": "tool",
                "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
                "content": str(result)
            }
        ]
    )
    print(final_response.choices[0].message.content)
```

At this small scale, the traditional approach is simpler. The key differences become apparent when:

1. **Scale increases**: With dozens of tools, the MCP approach provides better organization
2. **Reuse matters**: The MCP server can be used by multiple clients and applications
3. **Distribution is needed**: MCP provides standard mechanisms for remote operation

### When to Use MCP vs. Traditional Approaches

**Consider MCP when**:

- You need to share tool implementations across multiple applications
- You're building a distributed system with components on different machines
- You want to leverage existing MCP servers from the ecosystem
- You're building a product where standardization provides user benefits

**Traditional approaches may be better when**:

- You have a simpler, self-contained application
- Performance is critical (direct function calls have less overhead)
- You're early in development and rapid iteration is more important than standardization
