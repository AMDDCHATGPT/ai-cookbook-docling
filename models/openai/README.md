# OpenAI Responses API

## What we will cover

1. Introduction
2. Text prompting
3. Conversation states
4. Function calling
5. Structured output
6. Web search
7. Reasoning
8. File search

## Most important things to know

1. **Migration Timeline**: The Responses API will eventually replace the Chat Completions API. OpenAI plans to sunset Chat Completions by the end of 2026, giving developers a transition period.

2. **Backward Compatibility**: The Responses API is a superset of Chat Completions - everything you can do with Chat Completions can be done with Responses API, plus additional features.

3. **Key New Features**:
   - Simplified interface for different interaction types (chat, text, function calls, structured output)
   - Native support for web search capabilities
   - Improved reasoning parameters
   - Built-in file search functionality
   - Simplified conversation state management

4. **When to Migrate**:
   - For new applications: Start with Responses API to be future-proof
   - For existing applications: Begin planning migration, but no immediate urgency
   - Test the new API in parallel with existing implementations

5. **Implementation Considerations**:
   - API structure changes but core AI engineering principles remain the same
   - Features that previously required multiple API calls can now be done in single calls
   - The fundamental patterns of retrieval, tools, and memory management still apply

6. **Documentation Resources**:
   - Official OpenAI documentation: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses
